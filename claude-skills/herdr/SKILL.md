# herdr — agent skill

before using this skill, check that `HERDR_ENV=1`. if it is not set to `1`, say you are not running inside a herdr-managed pane and stop. do not inspect or control the focused herdr pane from outside herdr.

you are running inside herdr, a terminal-native agent multiplexer. herdr gives you workspaces, tabs, and panes — each pane is a real terminal with its own shell, agent, server, or log stream — and you can control all of it from the cli.

this means you can:

- see what other panes and agents are doing
- create tabs for separate subcontexts inside one workspace
- split panes and run commands in them
- start servers, watch logs, and run tests in sibling panes
- wait for specific output before continuing
- wait for another agent to finish
- spawn more agent instances

the `herdr` binary is available in your PATH. its workspace, tab, pane, and wait commands talk to the running herdr instance over a local unix socket.

if you need the raw protocol or full api reference, read the [socket api docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/).

## concepts

**workspaces** are project contexts. each workspace has one or more tabs. unless manually renamed, a workspace's label follows the first tab's root pane — usually the repo name, otherwise the root pane's current folder name.

**tabs** are subcontexts inside a workspace. each tab has one or more panes.

**panes** are terminal splits inside a tab. each pane runs its own process — a shell, an agent, a server, anything.

**agent status** is detected automatically by herdr. the api exposes one public field for it:

- `agent_status` — `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, `done`, `unknown`

`done` means the agent finished, but you have not looked at that finished pane yet.

plain shells still exist as panes, but herdr's sidebar agent section intentionally focuses on detected agents rather than listing every shell.

**ids** — workspace ids look like `1`, `2`. tab ids look like `1:1`, `1:2`, `2:1`. pane ids look like `1-1`, `1-2`, `2-1`. these are compact public ids for the current live session.

important: ids can compact when tabs, panes, or workspaces are closed. do not treat them as durable ids. re-read ids from `workspace list`, `tab list`, `pane list`, or create/split responses when you need a current id. do not guess that an older `1-3` is still the same pane later.

## discover yourself

see what panes exist and which one is focused:

```bash
herdr pane list
```

the focused pane is yours. other panes are your neighbors.

list workspaces:

```bash
herdr workspace list
```

## tab management

list tabs in the current workspace:

```bash
herdr tab list --workspace 1
```

create a new tab:

```bash
herdr tab create --workspace 1
```

without `--label`, the new tab keeps the default numbered tab name.

create and name it in one step:

```bash
herdr tab create --workspace 1 --label "logs"
```

rename it:

```bash
herdr tab rename 1:2 "logs"
```

focus it:

```bash
herdr tab focus 1:2
```

close it:

```bash
herdr tab close 1:2
```

## read another pane

see what is on another pane's screen:

```bash
herdr pane read 1-1 --source recent --lines 50
```

- `--source visible` = current viewport
- `--source recent` = recent scrollback as rendered in the pane
- `--source recent-unwrapped` = recent terminal text with soft wraps joined back together

## split a pane and run a command

split your pane to the right and keep focus on your current pane:

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus
```

that prints json with the new pane nested at `result.pane.pane_id`. parse that value, then run a command in that pane:

```bash
NEW_PANE=$(herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["pane"]["pane_id"])')
herdr pane run "$NEW_PANE" "npm run dev"
```

split downward instead:

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction down --no-focus
```

## wait for output

block until specific text appears in a pane. useful for waiting on servers, builds, and tests.

for `--source recent`, matching uses unwrapped recent terminal text, so pane width and soft wrapping do not break matches. `pane read --source recent` still shows the pane as rendered. if you want to inspect the same transcript that the waiter matches, use `pane read --source recent-unwrapped`.

```bash
herdr wait output 1-3 --match "ready on port 3000" --timeout 30000
```

with regex:

```bash
herdr wait output 1-3 --match "server.*ready" --regex --timeout 30000
```

if it times out, exit code is `1`.

## wait for an agent status

block until another agent reaches a specific status:

```bash
herdr wait agent-status 1-1 --status done --timeout 60000
```

use this when you want the same `done` / `idle` distinction the UI shows.

## send text or keys to a pane

send text without pressing Enter:

```bash
herdr pane send-text 1-1 "hello from claude"
```

press Enter or other keys:

```bash
herdr pane send-keys 1-1 Enter
```

`pane run` sends the text and then a real `Enter` key in one request:

```bash
herdr pane run 1-1 "echo hello"
```

## workspace management

create a new workspace:

```bash
herdr workspace create --cwd /path/to/project
```

without `--label`, the new workspace keeps the default cwd-based name.

create and name one in one step:

```bash
herdr workspace create --cwd /path/to/project --label "api server"
```

create one without focusing it:

```bash
herdr workspace create --no-focus
```

focus a workspace:

```bash
herdr workspace focus 2
```

rename:

```bash
herdr workspace rename 1 "api server"
```

close:

```bash
herdr workspace close 2
```

## close a pane

```bash
herdr pane close 1-3
```

## recipes

### run a server and wait until it is ready

```bash
NEW_PANE=$(herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["pane"]["pane_id"])')
herdr pane run "$NEW_PANE" "npm run dev"
herdr wait output "$NEW_PANE" --match "ready" --timeout 30000
herdr pane read "$NEW_PANE" --source recent --lines 20
```

### run tests in a separate pane and inspect the result

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction down --no-focus
herdr pane run 1-3 "cargo test"
herdr wait output 1-3 --match "test result" --timeout 60000
herdr pane read 1-3 --source recent --lines 30
```

### check what another agent is working on

```bash
herdr pane list
herdr pane read 1-1 --source recent --lines 80
```

### watch another pane robustly

use this pattern when you need to coordinate with a sibling pane:

```bash
# inspect what is already there
herdr pane read 1-3 --source recent --lines 40

# wait only for the next output you expect
herdr wait output 1-3 --match "ready" --timeout 30000

# if you need to inspect the same transcript the waiter matched,
# read the unwrapped recent text directly
herdr pane read 1-3 --source recent-unwrapped --lines 40
```

### spawn a new agent and give it a task

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus
herdr pane run 1-3 "claude"
herdr wait output 1-3 --match ">" --timeout 15000
herdr pane run 1-3 "review the test coverage in src/api/"
```

### coordinate with another agent

```bash
herdr wait agent-status 1-1 --status done --timeout 120000
herdr pane read 1-1 --source recent --lines 100
```

## layout spec shorthand

the user may describe a whole layout as a short spec:

```
workspace a:
- 1
- 2

workspace b:
- 1
- 3
```

each `workspace` block becomes one workspace, each list item a tab in it. build it like this:

1. `herdr workspace create --cwd "$DIR" --label "<name>" --no-focus` — default `--cwd` is the directory the user is working in; never guess another path.
2. a new workspace already contains one tab with one pane. reuse it for the first list item: rename it via `herdr tab rename "$TAB_ID" "<first item>"` (ids from `result.tab.tab_id` and `result.root_pane.pane_id`). do not create an extra tab.
3. `herdr tab create --workspace "$WS_ID" --cwd "$DIR" --label "<item>" --no-focus` for the remaining items.
4. if the user says "with claude" / "launch claude": `herdr pane run "$PANE_ID" claude` in every created tab. herdr auto-detects the agent in the pane — no registration needed.
5. verify with `herdr tab list --workspace "$WS_ID"` and report created ids.

tab and workspace names come verbatim from the user's spec.

## worktrees

create a git worktree plus a workspace rooted in it — isolated checkout, so parallel agents never stomp each other's files:

```bash
herdr worktree create --cwd /path/to/repo --branch feat/auth [--base REF] --label "auth" --no-focus
```

list and remove:

```bash
herdr worktree list [--workspace ID | --cwd PATH]
herdr worktree open [--workspace ID | --cwd PATH] (--path PATH | --branch NAME)
herdr worktree remove --workspace ID [--force]
```

use a worktree-backed workspace per feature when the user runs several features in parallel on one repo.

## agent commands

higher-level helpers over detected agents. targets accept terminal ids, unique agent names, detected/reported agent labels, and legacy pane ids:

```bash
herdr agent list
herdr agent send <target> "text"        # literal text; use pane run for text + Enter
herdr agent read <target> --lines 40
herdr agent wait <target> --status idle --timeout 60000
herdr agent rename <target> <name>
herdr agent start <name> [--cwd PATH] [--workspace ID] [--tab ID] [--split right|down] -- <argv...>
```

caution: `agent start --workspace/--tab` always splits a new pane next to the existing one. for one-pane-per-tab layouts, create the tab first and use `herdr pane run "$PANE_ID" claude` instead.

## notes

- `workspace list`, `workspace create`, `tab list`, `tab create`, `tab get`, `tab focus`, `tab rename`, `tab close`, `pane list`, `pane get`, `pane split`, `wait output`, and `wait agent-status` print json on success.
- `pane read` prints text, not json.
- `pane read --format ansi` or `pane read --ansi` returns a rendered ANSI snapshot for TUI feedback loops.
- `pane read --source recent-unwrapped` is useful when you want to inspect the same unwrapped transcript that `wait output --source recent` matches against.
- `pane send-text`, `pane send-keys`, and `pane run` print nothing on success.
- parse ids from `workspace create`, `tab create`, and `pane split` responses when you need new ids. `workspace create` returns `result.workspace`, `result.tab`, and `result.root_pane`. `tab create` returns `result.tab` and `result.root_pane`. for `pane split`, the new pane id is at `result.pane.pane_id`.
- use `pane read` for current output that already exists. use `wait output` for future output you expect next.
- `--no-focus` on split, tab create, and workspace create keeps your current terminal context focused.
- without `--label`, workspace create keeps cwd-based naming and tab create keeps numbered naming.
- `--label` on tab create and workspace create applies the custom name immediately.
- if you are running inside herdr, the `HERDR_ENV` environment variable is set to `1`.
